Communication

Our communication plan is to use discord. We are going to try to communicate daily through it as we make progress, and share our files . Our chat will contain shared files. We will check in daily to see what we are doing.We will use Trello to keep track of our project. It will be used to create deadlines and keep track of each other's work. We will also try to meet up once a week.
